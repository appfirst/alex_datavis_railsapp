AppFirst Internship Summer 2013 -- Alexandra Orth

Concept (temporary): Rails app that will link to the different data views.

First visualization using d3.js. "Bubbles" created based on server's "capacity_mem" attribute. Colors intensity is also determined using the "capactiy_mem" attribute. 

Working on: d3.js topographic visualization of server location. Graphs, graphs, graphs.

.gitignore includes:
	/tmp
	/db
	*.json
	*.yml

Note: Front page up and running. Using Bootstrap so everything doesn't look so clunky.

Note: No database setup
